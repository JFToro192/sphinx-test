Hazard Mapping 
=======================================
In this section we will revisit some of the contents and tools introduced in previous chapters presenting two different scenarios hazard assessment.

This is a new paragraph.

**This is some random test meant to be bold**

The following statemens present the syntax for creating different type of boxes to add comments to the documentation.

.. code-block:: php

   $a = 'b';

`result = (1 + x) * 32`

Fire Mapping
------------

In this section we will dedicate our attention on the processing of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to build a hazard map assessing the damage from a fire event in the vicinity of an urban area.

* **Overview**

A wildfire is a rapidly spreading fire that also occur in woodland areas. Annual dry seasons or drought provide an ideal environment for biomass and dry conditions to combine. Ignition sources for wildfires can relate to natural events, such as lightning strikes or lava flow. Unfortunately, they can also be man-made, resulting from the burning of debris, unattended campfires and intentional arson.

Wildfires can result in the loss of human life, wildlife, and impact directly, or indirectly, different ecological processes due to the removal of the vegetation layer (Petropoulos, Griffiths, & Kalivas, 2014). Therefore, it is essential the assessment of the severity of the impacted areas. This practice aims at assessing an affected area using remote sensing tools. The methodology will benefit from the use of the open satellite imagery published at the Copernicus Sci-Hub. Here, using Sentinel-2 imagery, you will model the severity of a wildfire in the Campania Region in Italy (in the vicinity of Sarno). The severity assessment considers the comparison of pre- and post-event imagery by computing the Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) on each scenario.

* **Objective**

The purpose of this practice is to guide you on assessing the post-fire burnt severity.

   * Disaster type: Wildfire
   * Disaster Cycle Phase: Recovery and Reconstruction, Relief and Response

* **Global Human Settlement Layer**

The `Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) <https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/>`_ project produces timely geospatial information of human presence on the planet. Through the used of spatial data mining technologies, the project harvests information with evidence-based analytics and knowledge. The information is exposed as built-up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. The GHSL profits from the use of heterogeneous data such as satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information.

* **Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) - Population**

The `Global Human Settlement Layer Population layer (GHSL-POP ) <https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_pop2019.php>`_ [2]_ is a spatial raster dataset depicting the distribution and density of the population expressed in number of people by cell. The production of this imagery is possible through the disaggregation of census or administrative spatial data into cells. Values are expressed as decimals (Float) and represent the absolute number of inhabitants of the cell. The residential population targets the years 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2015. The GHSL-POP datasets can be described by: 

   * Product name: GHS_POP_MT_GLOBE_R2019A
   * Coordinate System: World Mollweide (EPSG:54009), WGS (EPSG:4326)
   * Resolution available:  250m, 1km, 9 arcsec, 30 arcsec

The naming convention for the GHSL-POP datasets is defined as *“{Product Name}_{Coordinate System}_{Resolution}_{Version}”* (e.g. GHS_POP_E2015_GLOBE_R2019A_4326_9SS_V1_0, that is the version 1 of GHSL-POP dataset for 2015 referred to WGS84 with a resolution of 9 arcsec). 

.. note:: ``NoData`` cells are assigned -200 as value.

After following the steps as presented in :numref:`4.2.3.1`, you will find a web viewer visualizing the tiles for the GHSL-POP products.
